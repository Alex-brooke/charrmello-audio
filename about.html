                    Charrmello is a cinematic audio platform. I manifested itself becuase I like the whole idea of
                    bringing
                    audio content to life. It came from me, an avid listener of audiobooks who at many occasions found
                    listening
                    to be pretty boring and tedious at times. I thought to myself, what if it was like a movie that you
                    listen
                    to? Infact, what if this whole thing was like netflix but for your ears?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then there was my co-founder Josh, who loves education and learning, he wanted to know what could be
                    done to
                    reigninte learning, lowering the boundries for people and make it as accssible and as fun as
                    possible.

                    So that’s our short but sweet story of Charrmello; two product design graduates wanting, searching
                    for a way
                    to better the world. Sounds basic, but it’s not. It means a lot to us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We really hope you get something out of using Charrmello, better still, we hope you stick around to
                    see and
                    become a part of the mazing stuff we long to be doing in the future.

                    All bless.
